<h1> Scantron Checker</h1>
<p>In this program it was meant to be a scantron check for a project I was working on, but it can be used in numerous cases that require checking the accuracy and output the positions of matches (C) and differnt ones (W). This program starts checking starting from second position (index 1) and checks 20 (can be changed by changing the size variables (keySiz and ansSiz)) values for 2 differrent arrays.</p>
<h3> Installation:</h3>
You can download the code by:<br> 
- clicking the download zip file<br>
- git cloning --> <br>
```git clone https://github.com/J0eyhacksgibsons/Misc/new/main/scantron%20checker```
<br>
- copy the code to a file with an extension of .cpp<br>
<br>
<h3> Compiling:</h3>
To run a program from languages like C/C++, you need to compile the code to become an executable.<br/>
To compile you need a compiler, you can choose your favorite. Some options that come to mind would be g++ for Linux ```g++ scantron_checker.cpp -o scantronchecker``` (can be built in based on the distribution) and an IDE built in compiler for Windows, there are more options available to explore.<br/>
<h3> Execution: </h3>
After Compilation you can run it by:<br/>
- Clicking on the file on windows with a gui. <br/>
- Run it from the command prompt ```start scantronchecker/``` (make sure you're in the same folder)<br/>
- On Linux after being in the same directory or setting path ```./scantronchecker```<br/>
