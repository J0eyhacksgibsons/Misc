Hey there this is a project that I've worked on in my journey to learn Python. It's a very known game called "Rock Paper Scissors". If you don't know it you can check the rules below:<br>
```https://wrpsa.com/the-official-rules-of-rock-paper-scissors/```<br>
You can check if you have it by going to the terminal and entering<br>
```python --version, python, or py```<br>
If not you can download Python on Linux:<br>
```sudo apt install python```<br>
You can change the packet manager in the line above, if you don't use "apt". <br>
For Windows you can visit the Python website below:<br>
```https://www.python.org/downloads```<br>
Choose your windows version and follow instructions from there.<br>
For both Windows and Linux: you can copy it or save it as a zip from the top right of the code.<br>
To run the code in the command line while in the same directory ```python rock_paper_scissors.py``` <br>
It should work from there.<br>
