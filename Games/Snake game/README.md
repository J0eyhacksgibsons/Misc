<h1>Snake Game</h1>
<p>Hey there this is a project that I've worked on in my journey to learn Python. It's a very known game called the "Snake Game".You have to keep using the
  arrows keys (i.e. Up, Down, Left, and Right) to move the snake and eat the food displayed as dots, which will let you earn points. The high score will be 
  shown on the top, as a player you are trying to beat it everytime.</p>
<br>
<h2>Checking if Python is installed</h2>
<p>You can check if you have it by going to the terminal and entering:
<br>
python --version, python, or py
<br>
If not you can download Python on any platform.</p>
<br>
<h2>Download Python</h2>
<h3>Linux:</h3>
<br>
sudo apt install python
<br>
You can change the packet manager in the line above, if you don't use "apt". 
<h3>Windows:</h3>
For Windows you can visit the Python website below:
<br>
https://www.python.org/downloads
<br>
Choose your windows version and follow instructions from there.<br>
<h2>Downloading the code</h2>
For both Windows and Linux: you can copy it or save it as a zip from the top right of the code.<br>
<h2>Running the code</h2>
To run the code in the command line while in the same directory:
<br>
python main.py
<br>
It should work from there.
